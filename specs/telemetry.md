## Implementation Notes

### Client Identification Usage
**`client_type` only:**
- Direct client interactions: calls, operation calls/latency, response size, token estimation, timeouts
- Error analysis: request errors, auth failures
- Connection events: client connected/disconnected, auth failed  
- Purpose: Analyze client behavior patterns and identify client-specific issues

**No client identification:**
- Server configuration: config loads, tool registration, schema info, version info
- System metrics: CPU, memory, network, active clients, concurrency
- Backend operations: GraphQL backend errors, operation type mix, transport errors
- Traces: tool invocation spans, GraphQL operations, serialization
- Purpose: Server-wide metrics and request-level tracing independent of client behavior

### Client Identification Implementation
- **`client_type`**: Static client identifier derived from User-Agent header or configuration
  - Examples: `"claude"`, `"chatgpt"`, `"vscode"`, `"custom"`, `"unknown"`
  - Used for understanding client behavior patterns and performance differences
  - No PII concerns - represents client software type, not individual users
  - Optional: Use `"unknown"` if client type cannot be determined or for privacy

### Privacy & Retention
- Client identification is optional - use `"unknown"` if privacy concerns exist
- No PII concerns with `client_type` - it represents software, not users
- Ensure compliance with local data protection regulations

### Token & Cost Estimation
- **Real-time**: Use `apollo_mcp.responses.characters` for fast proxy estimation
  - Rule of thumb: 1 token ≈ 3-4 characters for most content
  - No performance impact - just `response.length`
- **Offline/Optional**: For precise token counts, run tokenization in background jobs
  - Sample a subset of responses (e.g., 1-10%) to avoid performance impact
  - Use established tokenizers (tiktoken for OpenAI models, similar for others)
  - Store results separately from real-time metrics
  - Actual token counts will vary by model and tokenizer
