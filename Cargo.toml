# The Rust MCP SDK has not had a release in a long time, so we need to depend on it through GitHub to pick up things
# like Streamable HTTP support. This particular commit is pinned because it is before a change to the way shutdown is
# handled through Axum which broke the ability to shut down the server with Ctrl-C.
