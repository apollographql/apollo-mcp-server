ðŸš€ TheSpaceDevs API Execution Hints:

â€¢ Popular queries to explore:
  - Launch data: Use 'launches' field with filters like upcoming, status, or date ranges
  - Spacecraft info: Query 'spacecraft' for technical details and mission history
  - Astronaut data: Access 'astronauts' for crew information and flight records
  - Agency details: Use 'agencies' to get space organization information

â€¢ Common filter patterns:
  - Date filtering: Use 'net__gte' and 'net__lte' for launch time windows
  - Status filtering: 'status__ids' accepts arrays like [1,3,4] for launch statuses
  - Limit results: Always include 'limit' parameter to control response size

â€¢ Best practices:
  - Start with small limit values (10-20) to avoid large responses
  - Use 'ordering' parameter to sort results (e.g., 'net' for launch date)
  - Check 'total_count' in responses to understand dataset size
  - Combine multiple fields for richer data (launches + spacecraft + agencies)

â€¢ Example useful queries:
  - Next SpaceX launches: filter by agency name and upcoming status
  - ISS crew rotations: query astronauts with ISS mission filters
  - Recent successful launches: filter by status and recent dates
