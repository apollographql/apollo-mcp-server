# Support for MCP Apps and OpenAI AppsSDK

This release includes support for MCP Apps and the OpenAI Apps SDK via our [AI Apps Template](https://github.com/apollographql/ai-apps-template) utilizing the [@apollo/client-ai-apps](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-ai-apps) Apollo Client integration library.

This pattern enables serving AI Apps built with Apollo Client to platforms like ChatGPT, Goose, and others via Apollo MCP Server.
