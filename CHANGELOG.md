# [0.8.0] - 2025-09-12

## üöÄ Features

### feat: Configuration for disabling authorization token passthrough - @swcollard PR #336

A new optional new MCP Server configuration parameter, `transport.auth.disable_auth_token_passthrough`, which is `false` by default, that when true, will no longer pass through validated Auth tokens to the GraphQL API.

### Configure Codecov with coverage targets - @DaleSeo PR #337

This PR adds `codecov.yml` to set up Codecov with specific coverage targets and quality standards. It helps define clear expectations for code quality. It also includes some documentation about code coverage in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and adds the Codecov badge to `README.md`.

### Implement Test Coverage Measurement and Reporting - @DaleSeo PR #335

This PR adds the bare minimum for code coverage reporting using [cargo-llvm-cov](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-llvm-cov) and integrates with [Codecov](https://www.codecov.io/). It adds a new `coverage` job to the CI workflow that generates and uploads coverage reporting in parallel with existing tests. The setup mirrors that of Router, except it uses `nextest` instead of the built-in test runner and CircleCI instead of GitHub Actions.

### chore: update RMCP dependency ([328](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/issues/328))

Update the RMCP dependency to the latest version, pulling in newer specification changes.

### ci: Pin stable rust version ([Issue #287](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/issues/287))

Pins the stable version of Rust to the current latest version to ensure backwards compatibility with future versions.



# [0.7.5] - 2025-09-03

## üêõ Fixes

### fix: Validate ExecutableDocument in validate tool - @swcollard PR #329

Contains fixes for https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/issues/327

The validate tool was parsing the operation passed in to it against the schema but it wasn't performing the validate function on the ExecutableDocument returned by the Parser. This led to cases where missing required arguments were not caught by the Tool.

This change also updates the input schema to the execute tool to make it more clear to the LLM that it needs to provide a valid JSON object

## üõ† Maintenance

### test: adding a basic manual e2e test for mcp server - @alocay PR #320

Adding some basic e2e tests using [mcp-server-tester](https://github.com/steviec/mcp-server-tester). Currently, the tool does not always exit (ctrl+c is sometimes needed) so this should be run manually.

### How to run tests?
Added a script `run_tests.sh` (may need to run `chmod +x` to run it) to run tests. Basic usage found via `./run_tests.sh -h`. The script does the following:

1. Builds test/config yaml paths and verifies the files exist.
2. Checks if release `apollo-mcp-server` binary exists. If not, it builds the binary via `cargo build --release`.
3. Reads in the template file (used by `mcp-server-tester`) and replaces all `<test-dir>` placeholders with the test directory value. Generates this test server config file and places it in a temp location.
4. Invokes the `mcp-server-tester` via `npx`.
5. On script exit the generated config is cleaned up.

### Example run:
To run the tests for `local-operations` simply run `./run_tests.sh local-operations`

### Update snapshot format - @DaleSeo PR #313

Updates all inline snapshots in the codebase to ensure they are consistent with the latest insta format.

### Hardcoded version strings in tests - @DaleSeo PR #305

The GraphQL tests have hardcoded version strings that we need to update manually each time we release a new version. Since this isn't included in the release checklist, it's easy to miss it and only notice the test failures later.

# [0.7.4] - 2025-08-27

## üêõ Fixes

### fix: Add missing token propagation for execute tool - @DaleSeo PR #298

The execute tool is not forwarding JWT authentication tokens to upstream GraphQL endpoints, causing authentication failures when using this tool with protected APIs. This PR adds missing token propagation for execute tool.

# [0.7.3] - 2025-08-25

## üêõ Fixes

### fix: generate openAI-compatible json schemas for list types - @DaleSeo PR #272

The MCP server is generating JSON schemas that don't match OpenAI's function calling specification. It puts `oneOf` at the array level instead of using `items` to define the JSON schemas for the GraphQL list types. While some other LLMs are more flexible about this, it technically violates the [JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array) that OpenAI strictly follows.

This PR updates the list type handling logic to move `oneOf` inside `items` for GraphQL list types.

# [0.7.2] - 2025-08-19

## üöÄ Features

### Prevent server restarts while polling collections - @DaleSeo PR #261

Right now, the MCP server restarts whenever there's a connectivity issue while polling collections from GraphOS. This causes the entire server to restart instead of handling the error gracefully.

```
Error: Failed to create operation: Error loading collection: error sending request for url (https://graphql.api.apollographql.com/api/graphql)
Caused by:
    Error loading collection: error sending request for url (https://graphql.api.apollographql.com/api/graphql)
```

This PR prevents server restarts by distinguishing between transient errors and permanent errors.

## üêõ Fixes

### Keycloak OIDC discovery URL transformation - @DaleSeo PR #238

The MCP server currently replaces the entire path when building OIDC discovery URLs. This causes authentication failures for identity providers like Keycloak, which have path-based realms in the URL. This PR updates the URL transformation logic to preserve the existing path from the OAuth server URL.

### fix: build error, let expressions unstable in while - @ThoreKoritzius #263

Fix unstable let expressions in while loop
Replaced the unstable while let = expr syntax with a stable alternative, ensuring the code compiles on stable Rust without requiring nightly features.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Address Security Vulnerabilities - @DaleSeo PR #264

This PR addresses the security vulnerabilities and dependency issues tracked in Dependency Dashboard #41 (https://osv.dev/vulnerability/RUSTSEC-2024-0388).

- Replaced the unmaintained `derivate` crate with the `educe` crate instead.
- Updated the `tantivy` crate.

# [0.7.1] - 2025-08-13

## üöÄ Features

### feat: Pass `remote-mcp` mcp-session-id header along to GraphQL request - @damassi PR #236

This adds support for passing the `mcp-session-id` header through from `remote-mcp` via the MCP client config. This header [originates from the underlying `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` library](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/a1608a6513d18eb965266286904760f830de96fe/src/client/streamableHttp.ts#L182), invoked from `remote-mcp`.

With this change it is possible to correlate requests from MCP clients through to the final GraphQL server destination.

## üêõ Fixes

### fix: Valid token fails validation with multiple audiences - @DaleSeo PR #244

Valid tokens are failing validation with the following error when the JWT tokens contain an audience claim as an array.

```
JSON error: invalid type: sequence, expected a string at line 1 column 97
```

According to [RFC 7519 Section 4.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3), the audience claim can be either a single string or an array of strings. However, our implementation assumes it will always be a string, which is causing this JSON parsing error.
This fix updates the `Claims` struct to use `Vec<String>` instead of `String` for the `aud` field, along with a custom deserializer to handle both string and array formats.

### fix: Add custom deserializer to handle APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS environment variable parsing - @swcollard PR #220

The APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS environment variables has historically been a comma separated list of URL strings.
The move to yaml configuration allows us to more directly define the endpoints as a Vec.
This fix introduces a custom deserializer for the `apollo_uplink_endpoints` config field that can handle both the environment variable comma separated string, and the yaml-based list.

# [0.7.0] - 2025-08-04

## üöÄ Features

### feat: add mcp auth - @nicholascioli PR #210

The MCP server can now be configured to act as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, following
guidelines from the official MCP specification on Authorization / Authentication (see
[the spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization)).

To configure this new feature, a new `auth` section has been added to the SSE and
Streamable HTTP transports. Below is an example configuration using Streamable HTTP:

```yaml
transport:
  type: streamable_http
  auth:
    # List of upstream delegated OAuth servers
    # Note: These need to support the OIDC metadata discovery endpoint
    servers:
      - https://auth.example.com

    # List of accepted audiences from upstream signed JWTs
    # See: https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/guides/audiences
    audiences:
      - mcp.example.audience

    # The externally available URL pointing to this MCP server. Can be `localhost`
    # when testing locally.
    # Note: Subpaths must be preserved here as well. So append `/mcp` if using
    # Streamable HTTP or `/sse` is using SSE.
    resource: https://hosted.mcp.server/mcp

    # Optional link to more documentation relating to this MCP server.
    resource_documentation: https://info.mcp.server

    # List of queryable OAuth scopes from the upstream OAuth servers
    scopes:
      - read
      - mcp
      - profile
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Setting input_schema properties to empty when operation has no args ([Issue #136](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/issues/136)) ([PR #212](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/pull/212))

To support certain scenarios where a client fails on an omitted `properties` field within `input_schema`, setting the field to an empty map (`{}`) instead. While a missing `properties` field is allowed this will unblock
certain users and allow them to use the MCP server.

# [0.6.1] - 2025-07-29

## üêõ Fixes

### Handle headers from config file - @tylerscoville PR #213

Fix an issue where the server crashes when headers are set in the config file

### Handle environment variables when no config file is provided - @DaleSeo PR #211

Fix an issue where the server fails with the message "Missing environment variable: APOLLO_GRAPH_REF," even when the variables are properly set.

## üöÄ Features

### Health Check Support - @DaleSeo PR #209

Health reporting functionality has been added to make the MCP server ready for production deployment with proper health monitoring and Kubernetes integration.

# [0.6.0] - 2025-07-14

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Replace CLI flags with a configuration file - @nicholascioli PR #162

All command line arguments are now removed and replaced with equivalent configuration
options. The Apollo MCP server only accepts a single argument which is a path to a
configuration file. An empty file may be passed, as all options have sane defaults
that follow the previous argument defaults.

All options can be overridden by environment variables. They are of the following
form:

- Prefixed by `APOLLO_MCP_`
- Suffixed by the config equivalent path, with `__` marking nested options.

E.g. The environment variable to change the config option `introspection.execute.enabled`
would be `APOLLO_MCP_INTROSPECTION__EXECUTE__ENABLED`.

Below is a valid configuration file with some options filled out:

```yaml
custom_scalars: /path/to/custom/scalars
endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:4000
graphos:
  apollo_key: some.key
  apollo_graph_ref: example@graph
headers:
  X-Some-Header: example-value
introspection:
  execute:
    enabled: true
  introspect:
    enabled: false
logging:
  level: info
operations:
  source: local
  paths:
    - /path/to/operation.graphql
    - /path/to/other/operation.graphql
overrides:
  disable_type_description: false
  disable_schema_description: false
  enable_explorer: false
  mutation_mode: all
schema:
  source: local
  path: /path/to/schema.graphql
transport:
  type: streamable_http
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5000
```

## üöÄ Features

### Validate tool for verifying graphql queries before executing them - @swcollard PR #203

The introspection options in the mcp server provide introspect, execute, and search tools. The LLM often tries to validate its queries by just executing them. This may not be desired (there might be side effects, for example). This feature adds a `validate` tool so the LLM can validate the operation without actually hitting the GraphQL endpoint. It first validates the syntax of the operation, and then checks it against the introspected schema for validation.

### Minify introspect return value - @pubmodmatt PR #178

The `introspect` and `search` tools now have an option to minify results. Minified GraphQL SDL takes up less space in the context window.

### Add search tool - @pubmodmatt PR #171

A new experimental `search` tool has been added that allows the AI model to specify a set of terms to search for in the GraphQL schema. The top types matching that search are returned, as well as enough information to enable creation of GraphQL operations involving those types.

# [0.5.2] - 2025-07-10

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix ServerInfo - @pubmodmatt PR #183

The server will now report the correct server name and version to clients, rather than the Rust MCP SDK name and version.

# [0.5.1] - 2025-07-08

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix an issue with rmcp 0.2.x upgrade - @pubmodmatt PR #181

Fix an issue where the server was unresponsive to external events such as changes to operation collections.

# [0.5.0] - 2025-07-08

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Deprecate -u,--uplink argument and use default collection - @Jephuff PR #154

`--uplink` and `-u` are deprecated and will act as an alias for `--uplink-manifest`. If a schema isn't provided, it will get fetched from uplink by default, and `--uplink-manifest` can be used to fetch the persisted queries from uplink.
The server will now default to the default MCP tools from operation collections.

## üöÄ Features

### Add --version argument - @Jephuff PR #154

`apollo-mcp-server --version` will print the version of apollo-mcp-server currently installed

### Support operation variable comments as description overrides - @alocay PR #164

Operation comments for variables will now act as overrides for variable descriptions

### Include operation name with GraphQL requests - @DaleSeo PR #166

Include the operation name with GraphQL requests if it's available.

```diff
{
   "query":"query GetAlerts(: String!) { alerts(state: ) { severity description instruction } }",
   "variables":{
      "state":"CO"
   },
   "extensions":{
      "clientLibrary":{
         "name":"mcp",
         "version": ...
      }
   },
+  "operationName":"GetAlerts"
}
```

## üêõ Fixes

### The execute tool handles invalid operation types - @DaleSeo PR #170

The execute tool returns an invalid parameters error when the operation type does not match the mutation mode.

### Skip unnamed operations and log a warning instead of crashing - @DaleSeo PR #173

Unnamed operations are now skipped with a warning instead of causing the server to crash

### Support retaining argument descriptions from schema for variables - @alocay PR #147

Use descriptions for arguments from schema when building descriptions for operation variables.

### Invalid operation should not crash the MCP Server - @DaleSeo PR #176

Gracefully handle and skip invalid GraphQL operations to prevent MCP server crashes during startup or runtime.

# [0.4.2] - 2025-06-24

## üöÄ Features

### Pass in --collection default to use default collection - @Jephuff PR #151

--collection default will use the configured default collection on the graph variant specified by the --apollo-graph-ref arg

# [0.4.1] - 2025-06-20

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix tool update on every poll - @Jephuff PR #146

Only update the tool list if an operation was removed, changed, or added.

# [0.4.0] - 2025-06-17

## üöÄ Features

### Add `--collection <COLLECTION_ID>` as another option for operation source - @Jephuff PR #118

Use operation collections as the source of operations for your MCP server. The server will watch for changes and automatically update when you change your operation collection.

### Allow overriding registry endpoints - @Jephuff PR #134

Set APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS and APOLLO_REGISTRY_URL to override the endpoints for fetching schemas and operations

### Add client metadata to GraphQL requests - @pubmodmatt PR #137

The MCP Server will now identify itself to Apollo Router through the `ApolloClientMetadata` extension. This allows traffic from MCP to be identified in the router, for example through telemetry.

### Update license to MIT - @kbychu PR #122

The Apollo MCP Server is now licensed under MIT instead of ELv2

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix GetAstronautsCurrentlyInSpace query - @pubmodmatt PR #114

The `GetAstronautsCurrentlyInSpace` in the Quickstart documentation was not working.

### Change explorer tool to return URL - @pubmodmatt PR #123

The explorer tool previously opened the GraphQL query directly in the user's browser. Although convenient, this would only work if the MCP Server was hosted on the end user's machine, not remotely. It will now return the URL instead.

### Fix bug in operation directory watching - @pubmodmatt PR #135

Operation directory watching would not trigger an update of operations in some cases.

### fix: handle headers with colons in value - @DaleSeo PR #128

The MCP server won't crash when a header's value contains colons.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Automate changesets and changelog - @pubmodmatt PR #107
