subtitle: What you need to get started
---

Before building MCP Apps with Apollo MCP Server, make sure you have these prerequisites.

## Required prerequisites

- Apollo MCP Server
- GraphQL API endpoints that you want to expose through MCP Apps
- An MCP Apps-compatible host (for example, ChatGPT with OpenAI Apps SDK access, or another host that supports the MCP specification)

<Note>

If you're using ChatGPT and want to test end-to-end, you'll need a ChatGPT Plus account with OpenAI Apps SDK access (currently in preview/beta). Apps SDK access might require enrollment or approval from OpenAI. Check the [OpenAI Apps SDK documentation](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/quickstart/#add-your-app-to-chatgpt). 

If you're using another host, make sure it complies with the [Model Context Protocol specifications](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

</Note>

## Template-specific prerequisites

If you're using the [Apollo AI Apps Template](https://github.com/apollographql/ai-apps-template), you'll also need:

- Node.js v18 or later
- npm or yarn

<note> 

Tunneling tools, like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), can be helpful for local development with remote hosts if you want to test native interfaces.

</note>

## Next steps

Once you have all prerequisites in place:

1. Follow the [MCP Apps Quickstart](/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-quickstart) to create your first app
2. Review the [MCP Apps Overview](/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps) for architecture and concepts
3. Explore the [MCP Apps Reference](/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-reference) for detailed configuration
