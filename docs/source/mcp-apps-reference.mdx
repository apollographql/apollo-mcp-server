## App structure

An MCP App consists of your app code, UI resources, and GraphQL operations. Apps are organized in directories under `apps/`, each containing a generated manifest file (`.application-manifest.json`) and UI files.

## App manifest

The manifest file (`.application-manifest.json`) is automatically generated from your app code and `package.json`. Never edit the manifest directly. Instead, make changes to your app code and `package.json`, which will regenerate the manifest.

The generated manifest defines:
- GraphQL operations and their associated MCP tools
- Resource path (URL to your UI)
- Configuration (CSP, widget settings, labels)

## Resources

The resource is the UI for your app, specified as a URL. This can point to a local file, a built React app, or a remote URL. We recommend using the [Apollo AI Apps Template](https://github.com/apollographql/ai-apps-template) for a complete setup.

## Tools and operations

Each app defines tools that MCP Apps-compatible hosts can invoke. Tools are backed by GraphQL operations. Configure these in your app code and `package.json`—the manifest is generated from these sources.

Each operation includes:
- `body`: The GraphQL query or mutation
- `tools`: Array of tool definitions (name, description, optional extraInputs and labels)
- `prefetchID` (optional): Runs as a prefetch for all tools


## App query parameter

Use the `app` query parameter to specify which app to load: `https://your-server.com/mcp?app=my-app`. The app name corresponds to the directory name in `apps/`.

## App target

Apollo MCP Server supports two targets: **AppsSDK** (default, for hosts supporting OpenAI's Apps SDK specification) and **MCPApps** (for MCP-compatible clients). Specify via `appTarget` query parameter.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

CSP settings control external resource access. Configure in your app code or `package.json` (the manifest is generated from these):
- `connect_domains`: Network requests (fetch, XHR, WebSocket)
- `resource_domains`: Resources (images, scripts, stylesheets)
- `frame_domains`: Iframe embeds
- `redirect_domains`: Redirects (AppsSDK only)

## Widget settings

Control app appearance in the host: `description`, `domain`, `prefersBorder`. Configure in your app code or `package.json`.

## Tool invocation labels

Customize user-facing messages during tool execution via `toolInvocation/invoking` and 
`toolInvocation/invoked` labels. Set at app or tool level.


## Configuration
The MCP Server automatically reloads when the manifest or resource files change. Multiple apps can coexist in the `apps/` directory, each accessible via its own `?app=app-name` parameter.
