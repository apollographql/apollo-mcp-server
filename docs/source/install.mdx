This feature is [experimental](/graphos/resources/feature-launch-stages#experimental). Your questions and feedback are highly valuedâ€”don't hesitate to get in touch with your Apollo contact or post in the [Apollo Community MCP Server Category](https://community.apollographql.com/c/mcp-server/41).

## Installation Methods

### Download container image

A container is built for the Apollo MCP Server with every release at `ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server`.

To download the **latest release** Docker container of Apollo MCP Server:

```bash
docker image pull ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server:latest
```

To download a **specific version** of Apollo MCP Server (recommended for CI environments to ensure predictable behavior):

```bash
# Note the `v` prefixing the version number
docker image pull ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server:v0.7.3
```

To download a specific version of Apollo MCP Server that is a release candidate:

```bash
# Note the `v` prefixing the version number and the `-rc` suffix
docker image pull ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server:v0.7.3-rc.1
```

<Note>

The container sets a few defaults for ease of use:

- **Working Directory is `/data`**: Make sure to mount static schemas / operations to this location
  using the volume flag when running [(`-v` / `--volume`)](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#volume).
- **HTTP Streamable Transport on port 5000**: Make sure to export container port 5000 for HTTP Streamable connections to
  the MCP server using the port flag when running [(`-p` / `--port`)](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#publish)

</Note>

### Apollo Runtime Container

The Apollo Runtime Container runs both the MCP Server and the [Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing) in a single container. It's useful for local development, testing, and production deployments.

Learn more about deploying and configuring this container in the [Runtime Container repository](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-runtime).
