## App not appearing in host

**Common causes:**
- Missing `?app=app-name` query parameter in URL
- Services not running (GraphQL API, React app, MCP server)

**Solutions:**
- Include app name in URL: `https://your-url/mcp?app=the-store`
- Verify all services are running (if using template)
- Check server logs for app loading errors
- Check your app code and `package.json`—the manifest is generated from these sources


## Resource loading issues

**"Failed to read resource"**: Verify resource path in your app code or `package.json` (the manifest is generated from these), ensure file exists, check permissions, and if using template, ensure React app is running.

**Remote resource fails**: Verify URL is accessible, uses HTTPS, CORS is configured if needed, and server can reach the URL.

## CSP violations

**Symptoms**: Resources fail to load, network requests blocked, console CSP errors.

**Solutions**: Configure CSP in your app code or `package.json` (the manifest is generated from these) with required domains (`connect_domains`, `resource_domains`, `frame_domains`). Ensure domains include protocol (`https://`) and no trailing slashes. List all domains your app needs.

## Tool execution problems

**Tool executes but returns errors**: Verify GraphQL endpoint is correct and accessible, check authentication headers if needed, test operation directly against API, ensure operation matches schema.


## Hot reload issues

**Changes not reflected**: Verify your app code and `package.json` are saved. The manifest is regenerated automatically. Restart server if hot reload isn't working. If using the Apollo template, restart the `start mcp` script.

## Template-specific issues

**React app not building**: Check Node.js v18+, install dependencies, verify build output, ensure dev server is running.

**App query parameter not working**: Ensure app name in URL matches directory name in `apps/`, use format `?app=app-name` (not just `?appTarget=openai`), verify app directory exists with valid code and `package.json`.

## Debugging tips

- **Enable debug logging**: Set `logging.level: debug` in config
- **Use MCP Inspector**: Test with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp?app=the-store" --transport http` (include app parameter)
- **Check server logs**: Look for app loading messages and errors
- **Check app code and package.json**: Verify your source files are valid—the manifest is generated from these
- **Test GraphQL operations**: Test operations directly against your API

## Getting help

If issues persist: check server logs, verify your app code and `package.json`, test with MCP Inspector, review the [MCP Apps Reference](/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-reference), check [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/issues), or join the [Apollo community forums](https://community.apollographql.com/c/mcp-server/41).
