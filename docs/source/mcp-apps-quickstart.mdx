title: MCP Apps Quickstart Guide
subtitle: Create your first MCP App in minutes
---

This guide walks you through creating your first MCP App using the [Apollo AI Apps Template](https://github.com/apollographql/ai-apps-template). The template provides a complete setup with React, Vite, Apollo Client, and Apollo MCP Server integration.

<Note>

This guide uses ChatGPT as an example, but MCP Apps work with any host that supports the MCP Apps specification.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have all the [MCP Apps Prerequisites](/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-prerequisites) in place, including:

- Apollo MCP Server
- A GraphQL API endpoint
- An MCP Apps-compatible host (this guide uses ChatGPT as an example)
- Node.js v18 or later (for the template)
- npm or yarn (for the template)
- (Optional) ngrok or similar tunneling tool (for accessing from your host)

## Step 1: Create your app from template

Use the Apollo AI Apps Template to scaffold your project:

```bash
npx tiged apollographql/ai-apps-template my-awesome-app
```

This creates a new directory `my-awesome-app` with all the necessary files and structure.

## Step 2: Navigate and install

Navigate to your new project directory and run the install script:

```bash
cd my-awesome-app
./install.sh
```

The install script sets up all dependencies and configures your project.

## Step 3: Understand the project structure

The template creates a project with the following structure:

```
my-awesome-app/
├── ecommerce-graph/          # Demo GraphQL API
├── dev/
│   └── the-store/            # Your React app (built with Vite)
├── apps/                      # Apps directory for MCP Server
├── mcp-config.yaml           # MCP Server configuration
├── schema.graphql             # GraphQL schema
└── start_mcp.sh              # Script to start MCP server
```

## Step 4: Start the services

You'll need to run three services in separate terminal windows:

### Terminal 1: Start the GraphQL API

```bash
cd ecommerce-graph
npm run dev
```

This starts the demo e-commerce GraphQL API on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Terminal 2: Start your React app

For end-to-end testing with your host (for example, ChatGPT):

```bash
cd dev/the-store
npm run dev:e2e
```

For local development and testing in an emulator:

```bash
cd dev/the-store
npm run dev
```

This builds and serves your React app, which is accessible to the MCP server.

### Terminal 3: Start the MCP server

From the root of your project, run this command:

```bash
./start_mcp.sh
```

That command starts the Apollo MCP Server, which:
- Loads your app from the `apps/` directory
- Connects to your GraphQL API
- Serves your React app as a resource
- Exposes MCP tools to your host (for example, ChatGPT)

## Step 5: Set up tunneling (for host access)

To access your locally running MCP server from your host (for example, ChatGPT), create a tunnel using ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

That command creates a public URL (for example, `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`) that tunnels to your local MCP server on port 8000.

<Note>

Make sure to note the HTTPS URL that ngrok provides. You'll need this in the next step.

</Note>

## Step 6: Connect to your host

Follow your host's documentation to connect your MCP server. For this example using ChatGPT, follow the instructions in the [OpenAI documentation](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk).

When adding your MCP server URL to your host (for example, ChatGPT) or MCP Inspector, use this format:

```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/mcp?app=the-store
```

**Important**: Include the `/mcp?app=the-store` query parameter. The `app` parameter tells the MCP server which app to load.

## Step 7: Test your app

Once connected to your host, test your app by invoking your tools. For example, when using ChatGPT, you might ask:

> "Show me the products available"

Your host should:
1. Call your MCP tool
2. Execute the GraphQL query against your API
3. Display the results using your React app's UI

## What you've built

You've created an MCP App (in this example, for ChatGPT) that:

- ✅ Uses React and Vite for a modern development experience
- ✅ Integrates with Apollo Client for GraphQL
- ✅ Executes GraphQL queries when invoked
- ✅ Displays results in a custom React UI
- ✅ Provides a richer experience than plain text
- ✅ Can be extended with more features

## Customizing your app

### Modify the React app

Edit files in `dev/the-store/` to customize your app's UI and behavior. The app uses:
- **React** for the UI framework
- **Vite** for building and bundling
- **Apollo Client** for GraphQL integration
- **Apollo MCP Server** for MCP Apps integration

### Update GraphQL operations

Modify the GraphQL operations in your app code or `package.json`. The manifest is automatically generated from those sources.

### Change the GraphQL API

Replace the demo `ecommerce-graph` with your own GraphQL API. Update the endpoint in `mcp-config.yaml`:

```yaml
endpoint: http://localhost:4000/  # Your GraphQL API endpoint
```

## Development workflow

### Local development

For local development and testing:

1. Run `npm run dev` in `dev/the-store/` (instead of `npm run dev:e2e`)
2. Use a local emulator or test environment
3. Make changes and see them hot-reload

### End-to-end testing

For testing with your host (for example, ChatGPT):

1. Run `npm run dev:e2e` in `dev/the-store/`
2. Start ngrok tunnel
3. Connect your host to your ngrok URL
4. Test your app in the real host environment

## Next steps

- Review the [MCP Apps Reference](/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-reference) for key concepts and configuration
- Check out [Troubleshooting](/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-troubleshooting) if you encounter issues
- Review the [template repository](https://github.com/apollographql/ai-apps-template) for more examples

## Configuration details

### MCP server configuration

The `mcp-config.yaml` file configures your MCP server. Key settings:

```yaml
endpoint: http://localhost:4000/  # Your GraphQL API
transport:
  type: streamable_http
  port: 8000
```

### App query parameter

When connecting to your MCP server, use the `app` query parameter to specify which app to load:

- `?app=the-store` - Loads the app named "the-store"
- The app name corresponds to the directory name in your `apps/` folder

### App target

By default, Apollo MCP Server uses the AppsSDK target (for example, for ChatGPT). You can also specify it explicitly:

```
https://your-url.ngrok-free.app/mcp?app=the-store&appTarget=openai
```

## Troubleshooting

### App not loading

- Ensure all three services are running (GraphQL API, React app, MCP server)
- Check that the `app` query parameter matches your app directory name
- Verify the MCP server can access your React app's build output

### Connection issues

- Verify ngrok is running and the URL is correct
- Check that port 8000 is accessible
- Ensure the MCP server started successfully

### GraphQL errors

- Verify your GraphQL API is running on the correct port
- Check the endpoint URL in `mcp-config.yaml`
- Test your GraphQL API directly with a tool like GraphQL Playground
