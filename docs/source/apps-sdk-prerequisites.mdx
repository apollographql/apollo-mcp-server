Before building ChatGPT apps with Apollo MCP Server, ensure you have the following prerequisites.

## Required prerequisites

- Apollo MCP Server
- GraphQL API endpoints that you want to expose through MCP Apps
- ChatGPT Plus account with OpenAI Apps SDK access (currently in preview/beta)

<Note>

Apps SDK access might require enrollment or approval from OpenAI. Check the [OpenAI Apps SDK documentation](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk) for current availability and requirements.

</Note>

## Template-specific prerequisites

If you're using the [Apollo AI Apps Template](https://github.com/apollographql/ai-apps-template), you'll also need:

- Node.js v18 or later
- npm or yarn
- Tunneling tool (for example, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) for local development with ChatGPT

## Next steps

Once you have all prerequisites in place:

1. Follow the [MCP Apps Quickstart](/apollo-mcp-server/apps-sdk-quickstart) to create your first app
2. Review the [MCP Apps Overview](/apollo-mcp-server/apps-sdk) for architecture and concepts
