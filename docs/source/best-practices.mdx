## Writing your schema for efficient MCP tools

The schema is required for:

- **Tool Descriptions**: The schema provides type information used to generate tool descriptions. You can override these descriptions by adding comments to your operation files.
- **Input Validation**: The schema is used to translate GraphQL input types into JSON Schema, ensuring that AI models provide correctly formatted inputs.
- **Introspection Support**: If you enable the `introspection` option, the schema is used to provide information about available types and operations to AI models.

## Use contract variants to control AI access to graphs

GraphOS [contract variants](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/contracts/overview) let you deliver different subsets of your graph to different consumers.

When running Apollo MCP Server with GraphOS, use contract variants whenever possible. This allows you to control which parts of your graph are accessible to AI by exposing only the necessary subsets.

In particular, we strongly recommend contract variants when using:

- [GraphOS-managed persisted queries](/apollo-mcp-server/define-tools#from-graphos-managed-persisted-queries)
- [Introspection](/apollo-mcp-server/define-tools#introspection-tools)

## Send client name header when using persisted queries

If you register a persisted query with a specific client name instead of `null`, you must configure the MCP Server to send the necessary header indicating the client name to the router.

Use the `headers` option when running the MCP Server to pass the header to the router. The default name of the header expected by the router is `apollographql-client-name`. To use a different header name, configure `telemetry.apollo.client_name_header` in router YAML configuration.

## Avoid token passthrough for authentication

Token passthrough forwards `Authorization` headers from MCP clients through MCP Servers to downstream APIs. Although it might seem useful in some multi-tenant setups, the Apollo MCP Server intentionally does not support this pattern and we strongly discourage its use.

According to [MCP security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) and the [MCP authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization#access-token-privilege-restriction), this pattern introduces serious security risks:

- **Audience confusion**: If the MCP Server accepts tokens not intended for it, it can violate OAuth’s trust boundaries.
- **Confused deputy problem**: If an unvalidated token is passed downstream, a downstream API may incorrectly trust it as though it were validated by the MCP Server.

To maintain clear trust boundaries, MCP servers must only accept tokens explicitly issued for themselves and must act as independent OAuth clients when calling upstream services.
Forwarding client tokens downstream is not allowed.

Apollo MCP Server supports OAuth 2.1 authentication that follows best practices and aligns with the MCP authorization model. See our [authorization guide](/apollo-mcp-server/auth) for implementation details.
