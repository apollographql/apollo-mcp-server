<ExperimentalFeature>

This feature is [experimental](/graphos/resources/feature-launch-stages#experimental). Your questions and feedback are highly valued—don't hesitate to get in touch with your Apollo contact or post in the [Apollo Community MCP Server Category](https://community.apollographql.com/c/mcp-server/41).

</ExperimentalFeature>

Here is the typical workflow for developing with Apollo MCP Server:

1. [Install the MCP server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-mcp-server/command-reference#installation-methods).
1. Set up the graph that the MCP Server sits in front of.
1. Define the GraphQL operations to expose as MCP tools.
1. Configure and run your MCP Server.
1. Connect an MCP client and run the tools.

## Set up graph

An Apollo MCP Server must know the schema of GraphQL API it supports. You can use either [the `schema` option to provide the schema or `graphos.apollo-graph-ref` and `graphos.apollo-key` options to get the schema from uplink](/apollo-mcp-server/command-reference#options). If using `schema` option, it can be either an API or supergraph schema.

The schema is required for three main purposes:

1. **Tool Descriptions**: The schema provides type information used to generate tool descriptions. You can override these descriptions by adding comments to your operation files.
1. **Input Validation**: The schema is used to translate GraphQL input types into JSON Schema, ensuring that AI models provide correctly formatted inputs.
1. **Introspection Support**: If you enable the `introspection` option, the schema is used to provide information about available types and operations to AI models.

## Define GraphQL operations for tools

You can manually define the GraphQL operations that are exposed by Apollo MCP Server as MCP tools. You can define these operations using:

- Operation files
- Persisted query manifests
- GraphOS-managed persisted queries

Alternatively, you can let an AI model read your graph schema via GraphQL introspection and have it determine the available operations.

### From operation files

An operation file is a `.graphql` file containing a single GraphQL operation.

<CodeColumns cols={2}>

```graphql title="Example operation GetForecast"
query GetForecast($coordinate: InputCoordinate!) {
  forecast(coordinate: $coordinate) {
    detailed
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Example operation GetWeatherData"
query GetAllWeatherData($coordinate: InputCoordinate!, $state: String!) {
  forecast(coordinate: $coordinate) {
    detailed
  }
  alerts(state: $state) {
    severity
    description
    instruction
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Use the `operations` option to provide the MCP Server with a list of operation files. For each operation file you provide, the MCP Server creates an MCP tool that calls the corresponding GraphQL operation.

You can also use the `operations` option to specify a directory. The server then loads all files with a `.graphql` extension in that directory as operations.

Files and directories specified with `operations` are hot reloaded. When you specify a file, the MCP tool is updated when the file contents are modified. When you specify a directory, operations exposed as MCP tools are updated when files are added, modified, or removed from the directory.

### From Operation Collection

For graphs managed by GraphOS, Apollo MCP Server can get operations from an [Operation Collection](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/explorer/operation-collections).

To use a GraphOS Operation Collection, you must:

- Set `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and `APOLLO_KEY` environment variables for a GraphOS graph

Each variant will have its own default MCP Tools Collection, but you can specify any shared collection by using `operations` with `operations.source: collection`.
Apollo MCP Server automatically fetches the default collection if no ID is specified.

```yaml title="Example config file for using a GraphOS Operation Collection"
operations:
  source: collection
  id: <collection-id>
```

The MCP Server supports hot reloading of the GraphOS Operation Collection, so it can automatically pick up changes from GraphOS without restarting.

### From persisted query manifests

Apollo MCP Server supports reading GraphQL operations from Apollo-formatted [persisted query manifest](/graphos/platform/security/persisted-queries#manifest-format) files.

Set the persisted query manifest file for the MCP Server with the `operations` option. The MCP Server supports hot reloading of persisted query manifests, so changes to manifests are applied without restarting.

An example manifest is available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/tree/main/graphql/weather/persisted_queries).

<ExpansionPanel title="Example command using --manifest">

From the root of a local MCP Server repo, run the `apollo-mcp-server` binary with the example persisted query manifest, `graphql/weather/persisted_queries/apollo.json`:

```yaml title="Example config for using Persisted Query Manifest"
headers:
  "apollographql-client-name": "my-web-app"
operations:
  source: manifest
  path: <absolute path to this local repo>/graphql/weather/persisted_queries/apollo.json
schema:
  source: local
  path: <absolute path to this local repo>/graphql/weather/api.graphql
```

```sh showLineNumbers=false
apollo-mcp-server <path to the preceding config>
```

</ExpansionPanel>

### From GraphOS-managed persisted queries

For graphs managed by GraphOS, Apollo MCP Server can get operations by reading persisted queries from GraphOS. The MCP Server uses Apollo Uplink to access the persisted queries.

To use GraphOS persisted queries, you must:

- Set `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and `APOLLO_KEY` environment variables for a GraphOS graph

<Tip>

Use a [contract variant](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/contracts/overview) with a persisted query list associated with that variant, so you can control what AI can consume from your graph. [Learn more](/apollo-mcp-server/best-practices#use-contract-variants-to-control-ai-access-to-graphs).

</Tip>

```yaml title="Example config using GraphOS-managed persisted queries"
headers:
  "apollographql-client-name": "my-web-app"
operations:
  source: uplink
schema:
  source: local
  path: <absolute path to this git repo>/graphql/weather/api.graphql
```

```sh title="Example command using GraphOS-managed persisted queries"
apollo-mcp-server <path to the preceding config>
```

The MCP Server supports hot reloading of GraphOS-managed persisted queries, so it can automatically pick up changes from GraphOS without restarting.

If you register a persisted query with a specific client name instead of `null`, you must configure the MCP Server to send the necessary header indicating the client name to the router.

Use the `headers` option when running the MCP Server to pass the header to the router. The default name of the header expected by the router is `apollographql-client-name`. To use a different header name, configure `telemetry.apollo.client_name_header` in router YAML configuration.

## Introspection tools

In addition to defining specific tools for pre-defined GraphQL operations, Apollo MCP Server supports introspection tools that enable AI agents to explore the graph schema and execute operations dynamically.

You can enable the following introspection tools:

- `introspect` - allows the AI model to introspect the schema of the GraphQL API by providing a specific type name to get information about, and a depth parameter to determine how deep to traverse the subtype hierarchy. The AI model can start the introspection by looking up the top-level `Query` or `Mutation` type.
- `search` - allows the AI model to search for type information by providing a set of search terms. This can result in fewer tool calls than `introspect`, especially if the desired type is deep in the type hierarchy of the schema. Search results include all the parent type information needed to construct operations involving the matching type.
- `validate` - validates a GraphQL operation against the schema without executing it. This allows AI models to verify that their operations are syntactically correct and conform to the schema before execution, preventing unintended side effects. Operations should be validated prior to calling the `execute` tool.
- `execute` - executes an operation on the GraphQL endpoint

The MCP client can use these tools to provide schema information to the model and its context window, and allow the model to execute GraphQL operations based on that schema.

<Tip>

Use a [contract variant](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/contracts/overview) so you can control the parts of your graph that AI can introspect. [Learn more](/apollo-mcp-server/best-practices#use-contract-variants-to-control-ai-access-to-graphs)

</Tip>

```yaml title="Example config using introspection"
introspection:
  execute:
    enabled: true
  introspect:
    enabled: true
  validate:
    enabled: true
```

```sh title="Example command using introspection"
apollo-mcp-server <path to the preceding config>
```

## Set up authorization

The Apollo MCP server supports authorizing clients (e.g. LLMs) in accordance with [the MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization).

Depending on whether you are connecting internal agents (first-party) or external agents (third-party, such as Claude, ChatGPT, or other public AI assistants), the steps to configure authorization will differ.

For internal (first-party) agents, you need:

- An [OAuth 2.1-compliant](https://oauth.net/2.1/) Identity Provider (for example, your own in-house IdP or a third-party IdP such as Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, etc)
- An Apollo Router [configured to use JWT authentication](/graphos/routing/security/jwt)

For external (third-party) agents, in addition to the preceding items, you also need:

- A configuration file for the MCP server that [defines the `auth` settings](/apollo-mcp-server/command-reference#auth)

### Example: Configure authentication with Auth0 and third-party agents

Here is an example of how to set up Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Router, with Auth0 as the Identity Provider for external/third-party access.

1. [Set up an Auth0 API](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis). You need your Auth0 domain for the next step.
2. Configure the Apollo Router to [use JWT authentication](/graphos/routing/security/jwt):

    This example router configuration enforces authentication on all requests and uses the JWKS endpoint provided by Auth0 to validate JWTs:

    ```yaml title="Router configuration for JWT authentication"
    authorization:
      require_authentication: true # Enforces authentication on all requests
    authentication:
      router:
        jwt:
          jwks:
            - url: https://<AUTH0 DOMAIN>/.well-known/jwks.json
    ```

3. Configure the MCP server to use the same Auth0 instance for authentication.

    This example MCP server configuration enforces authentication on all requests, delegating the actual login process to your previously-configured Auth0 instance:

    ```yaml title="Example MCP config for authentication"
    transport:
      type: streamable_http
      address: "0.0.0.0"

      auth:
        servers:
          - https://<AUTH0 DOMAIN>
        audiences:
          - <AUTH0 DEFAULT AUDIENCE>
        resource: http://localhost:5000
        scopes:
          - read:users
    ```

    Refer to the [Authentication configuration section in the command reference](/apollo-mcp-server/command-reference#auth) for more details on the available `auth` options.


## Deploying the MCP server

There are two ways to deploy and operate the MCP server.

1. Using the [MCP server container](#deploying-the-mcp-server-container) or binary, which connects to an existing GraphQL API endpoint
1. Using the [Apollo Runtime container](#deploying-mcp-using-the-apollo-runtime-container), which includes both an MCP server as well as the Apollo router

### Deploying the MCP server container

Apollo MCP Server is available as a standalone docker container. Container images are downloadable using
the image `ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server`.

By default, the container expects all schema and operation files to be present in the `/data` folder within the container
and that clients will use the Streamable HTTP transport on container port 5000.

An example `docker run` command that runs the MCP Server for the space dev example:

```yaml title="Example config for using Docker"
endpoint: https://thespacedevs-production.up.railway.app/
operations:
  source: local
  paths:
    - /data/operations/
schema:
  source: local
  path: /data/api.graphql
```

```sh showLineNumbers=false
docker run \
  -it --rm \
  --name apollo-mcp-server \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v <path to the preceding config>:/config.yaml \
  -v $PWD/graphql/TheSpaceDevs:/data \
  ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server:latest /config.yaml
```

### Deploying MCP using the Apollo Runtime container

The Apollo Runtime container includes all services necessary to serve GraphQL and MCP requests, including the Router and MCP Server. It is the easiest way to operate a GraphQL API with MCP support.

To serve both MCP and GraphQL requests, both port `4000` and `5000` will need to be exposed. An example command which retrieves the schema from Uplink is:

```bash title="Docker" {3, 6}
docker run \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  --env APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="<your-graph-ref>" \
  --env APOLLO_KEY="<your-graph-api-key>" \
  --env MCP_ENABLE=1 \
  --rm \
  ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-runtime:latest
```

To learn more, review the [Apollo Runtime container documentation](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker).

## Debugging with MCP Inspector

[MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is a debugging tool for MCP servers.

### Debug locally over stdio transport

You can inspect a local Apollo MCP Server by running it with MCP Inspector.

1. Run the MCP Server with Inspector:

```yaml title="Example config for debugging over stdio"
operations:
  source: local
  paths:
    - <absolute path to this git repo>/graphql/weather/operations/
schema:
  source: local
  path: <absolute path to this git repo>/graphql/weather/api.graphql
transport:
  type: stdio
```

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  target/debug/apollo-mcp-server <path to the preceding config>
```

<ExpansionPanel title="Example output">

```sh showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
Starting MCP inspector...
⚙️ Proxy server listening on port 6277
🔍 MCP Inspector is up and running at http://127.0.0.1:6274 🚀
```

</ExpansionPanel>

1. In a browser, go to the URL returned by Inspector, then click **Connect** and **List Tools**. You should see the tools for the operations you provided.

### Debug over the Streamable HTTP transport

When running the MCP Server over the Streamable HTTP transport, you can run MCP Inspector as follows.

1. Start the MCP Server in Streamable HTTP mode:

<Tip>

You can also deploy the server as a container using the instructions in [Deploying a Container](#deploying-a-container).

</Tip>

```yaml title="Example config for running in Streamable HTTP"
operations:
  source: local
  paths:
    - <absolute path to this git repo>/graphql/weather/operations/
schema:
  source: local
  path: <absolute path to this git repo>/graphql/weather/api.graphql
transport:
  type: streamable_http
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5000
```

```sh
target/debug/apollo-mcp-server <path to the above config>
```

1. Start the MCP Inspector:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

1. In a browser, go to the URL returned by Inspector, then fill in the details:

   - **Transport Type**: Select `Streamable HTTP`
   - **URL**: Enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/mcp`, where the port must match the `transport.port` option

1. Click **Connect** and **List Tools**. You should see the tools for the operations you provided.

## Health checks

Apollo MCP Server provides health check endpoints for monitoring server health and readiness. This feature is useful for load balancers, container orchestrators, and monitoring systems.

### Configuration

Health checks are only available when using the `streamable_http` transport and must be explicitly enabled:

```yaml title="Example health check configuration"
transport:
  type: streamable_http
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5000
health_check:
  enabled: true
  path: /health
  readiness:
    allowed: 50
    interval:
      sampling: 10s
      unready: 30s
```

### Endpoints

The health check provides different responses based on query parameters:

| Endpoint            | Description        | Response                                                         |
| :------------------ | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /health`       | Basic health check | Always returns `{"status": "UP"}`                                |
| `GET /health?live`  | Liveness check     | Returns `{"status": "UP"}` if server is alive                    |
| `GET /health?ready` | Readiness check    | Returns `{"status": "UP"}` if server is ready to handle requests |

### Probes

The server tracks failed requests and automatically marks itself as unready if too many failures occur within a sampling interval:

- **Sampling interval**: How often the server checks the rejection count (default: 5 seconds)
- **Allowed rejections**: Maximum failures allowed before becoming unready (default: 100)
- **Recovery time**: How long to wait before attempting to recover (default: 2x sampling interval)

When the server becomes unready:

- The `/health?ready` endpoint returns HTTP 503 with `{"status": "DOWN"}`
- After the recovery period, the rejection counter resets and the server becomes ready again

This allows external systems to automatically route traffic away from unhealthy servers and back when they recover.

## Custom scalars configuration

You can specify a custom scalars configuration JSON file to map a custom scalar to a [JSON schema type](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type). The JSON file is an object with custom scalar names as keys and JSON schema types as values:

```json
{
  "MyCustomScalar": { "type": "string" }
}
```

Other than JSON schema type, an overriding description can also be provided. In the following example the description provided in the schema, `scalar description`, would get overridden by the description found in the custom scalar configuration file, `override description`:

```graphql
"""
scalar description
"""
scalar MyCustomScalar
```

```json
{
  "MyCustomScalar": { "type": "string", "description": "override description" }
}
```
