## Known limitations

### OAuth token passthrough

Apollo MCP Server currently passes through OAuth tokens received from MCP clients directly to upstream GraphQL APIs.

#### Rationale 

The decision to pass through tokens stems from practical enterprise requirements that may conflict with the MCP specification. For example: 

- **Multi-user scenarios**: Enterprise GraphQL APIs often require direct user identity to perform granular access control and tenant isolation.
- **Existing enterprise patterns**: Many organizations have GraphQL APIs that depend on the original Authorization header to identify users and apply existing identity-based access controls.
- **Multi-tenant applications**: Upstream APIs frequently need to read the Authorization header to identify the tenant and apply appropriate data filtering.
- **User context propagation**: The MCP specification lacks clear guidance on how user/session/identity information should reach upstream APIs when they need to perform their own authorization logic.

#### Security implications

- Token passthrough can lead to confused deputy vulnerabilities.
- Upstream APIs might incorrectly trust tokens as if they were validated by the MCP server.
- Tokens intended for the MCP server audience might be inappropriately used with different services.
- However, if upstream APIs enforce proper audience (`aud` claim) validation, they should reject inappropriately scoped tokens.

#### Recommended workaround

- Use the MCP server only with GraphQL APIs that accept the same OAuth tokens and audiences
- Ensure your OAuth authorization server issues tokens with appropriate audience claims for both the MCP server and upstream APIs
- Verify that your upstream APIs properly validate token audiences
- Consider the security implications in your threat model, especially regarding OAuth trust boundaries

#### Future plans

We plan to address this limitation in a future release by implementing token exchange or separate authentication flows for upstream APIs, while still supporting the enterprise requirement for user identity propagation.
