title: Deploy the MCP Server
---

You can deploy and operate the MCP server by:

- Using the [MCP server container](#deploying-the-mcp-server-container) or binary, which connects to an existing GraphQL API endpoint
- Using the [Apollo Runtime container](#deploying-mcp-using-the-apollo-runtime-container), which includes both an MCP server as well as the Apollo router

### Deploy the MCP Server container

Apollo MCP Server is available as a standalone docker container. Container images are downloadable using
the image `ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server`.

By default, the container expects all schema and operation files to be present in the `/data` folder within the container
and that clients will use the Streamable HTTP transport on container port 5000.

An example `docker run` command that runs the MCP Server for the space dev example:

```yaml title="Example config for using Docker"
endpoint: https://thespacedevs-production.up.railway.app/
operations:
  source: local
  paths:
    - /data/operations/
schema:
  source: local
  path: /data/api.graphql
```

```sh showLineNumbers=false
docker run \
  -it --rm \
  --name apollo-mcp-server \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v <path to the preceding config>:/config.yaml \
  -v $PWD/graphql/TheSpaceDevs:/data \
  ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server:latest /config.yaml
```

### Deploy the MCP Server using the Apollo Runtime container

The Apollo Runtime container includes all services necessary to serve GraphQL and MCP requests, including the Router and MCP Server. It is the easiest way to operate a GraphQL API with MCP support.

To serve both MCP and GraphQL requests, both port `4000` and `5000` will need to be exposed. An example command which retrieves the schema from Uplink is:

```bash title="Docker" {3, 6}
docker run \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  --env APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="<your-graph-ref>" \
  --env APOLLO_KEY="<your-graph-api-key>" \
  --env MCP_ENABLE=1 \
  --rm \
  ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-runtime:latest
```
